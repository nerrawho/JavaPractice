1. In this file create a public class called Foo
2. Foo should have a public String variable called bar
3. Foo should have a public no-args constructor that sets the default value of bar to "bar"
4. Foo should have a public one-arg constructor that sets the value of bar to what ever value is input into the constructor
5. Foo should have a method called printBar which simply prints the value of your variable bar
